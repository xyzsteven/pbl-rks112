## Background
Cryptography is the science and practice of protecting data by transforming it into an unintelligible form, so that only a person with the correct key can read or decrypt it. This project aims to develop a classic cryptography application that allows users to secure text messages with the cryptography method.

## Features
1. User Interface
   - Clean and intuitive UI design using Tkinter with navigation menus are available to facilitate user movement between pages.
2. User Authentication
   - Implementation of user login and registration with data processing through a MySQL database with system provides notifications to users in case of login or registration errors.
3. Clipboard Integration
   - Facility to copy-paste text to and from the clipboard and users can easily input text for encryption or get decryption results to or from the clipboard.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Python 3 `or use` VS Code (for edit and run debugging the Python script)
- XAMPP (for running MySQL in localhost)
- MySQL server
- Tkinter library
- Pyperclip library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pbl-rks112.git
   ```
   ```
   cd pbl-rks112
   ```
   or
   Download manually the `pbl-rks112.py` file in main repository

2. Install additional Pyhton Library:

   ```
   pip install mysql-connector-python pyperclip
   ```
3. Install XAMPP and start MySQL module in XAMPP Control Panel
3. Run the script:
   
   ```
   python pbl-rks112.py
   ```
   or
   Manually run the `pbl-rks112.py` in VS Code with `Start Debugging` function
